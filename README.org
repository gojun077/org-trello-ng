~org-trello-ng~ is inspired by the original [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello][org-trello]] Emacs minor mode
for ~org-mode~. Unfortunately, the original project is no longer
maintained and the automated tests no longer run on Emacs 30.x and above.
~org-trello-ng~ aims to add missing functionality such as integration
with ~org-refile~ that will move Trello cards (i.e. ~refile~ org tasks)
to other Trello boards (org buffers). Also ~org-trello-ng~ will improve
the performance of syncing cards from Trello boards which the original
project was unable to handle when the number of cards was much greater than
100.
